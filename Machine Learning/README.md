suggestion.py is a python script used to partition users based on
selected parameters in order to determine which connections to
suggest and establish, as well as potentially determine which
events a user is most likely to prefer.

### TODO
- Look into more sophiscated ML algorithms
- Better determine object features by which to partition users
- develop event matching algorithm
