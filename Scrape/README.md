A python script for fetching TV show data and other.
This will most likely be a job that gets run on a daily basis through cron to reduce repetitive calls.
For now, this will store the retrieved data in csv.

### CURRENTLY SCRAPING

Hulu - they don't have public API but I seems to be able to retrieve it from http://m.hulu.com/search?query=sherlock

### TODO
- Scraping for Netflix
- Interface to access the fetched result
